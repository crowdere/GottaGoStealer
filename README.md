# GottaGoStealer
Blacktail/Buhti Ransomware Custom Exfiltration tool

I recreated the stealer described within a recent blog post by Symantec Threat Intelligence Team found here https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/buhti-ransomware.

This was never suppose to be good programing practice, nor extensivley created. I just wanted to try recreate and extend that project.
